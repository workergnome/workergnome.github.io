### Software Development.
#### Ruby, Sinatra, Redis, Heroku, Sentiment Analysis, Instagram API

As part of the leadup to the [Carnegie Museum of Art's](http://cmoa.org) Distant Feel Exhibit, the Gulf Tower, a landmark building in downtown Pittsburgh became a giant mood ring for Pittsburgh.

Using the Instagram API, I collected photos from across the Pittsburgh metropolitan area and analyzed them for their general mood.  This was used to calculate a positive and negative score for the entire city.

This score was then used to create a giant data visualization using the lighting on the Gulf Tower.
