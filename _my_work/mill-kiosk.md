I was commissioned by the [Emlenton Mill Foundation](http://www.emlentonmill.com) to work on a small installation for a museum in an historic grain mill in western Pennsylvania.  As part of their explanation of the working of the mill, I developed a iPad based interactive that would play informational videos, as well as display events, collect user feedback, and maintain metrics across the entire system.
