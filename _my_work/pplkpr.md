##### Ruby, Phantom JS, Facebook API, Redis, Sinatra, Resque

PPLKPR is a project by Lauren McCarthy and Kyle McDonald.

I was fortunate enough to work with them through the Studio for Creative Inquiry and develop an interface between the PPLKPR software and the Facebook website.  For their performance of PPLKPR, they wanted to automatically manipulate the Facebook accounts of the participantsâ€”often in ways that Facebook did not provide endpoints for.  To make this possible, I developed the [fakebook api](https://github.com/workergnome/fakebook_api), a system using PhantomJS to manipulate Facebook pages as if a real person were using it.
